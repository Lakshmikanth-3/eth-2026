sure there are no nested\n (reentrant) calls to them.\n Note that because there is a single `nonReentrant` guard, functions marked as\n `nonReentrant` may not call one another. This can be worked around by making\n those functions `private`, and then adding `external` `nonReentrant` entry\n points to them.\n TIP: If EIP-1153 (transient storage) is available on the chain

This address can then be used for verification purposes.\n The `ecrecover` EVM precompile allows for malleable (non-unique) signatures:\n this function rejects them by requiring the `s` value to be in the lower\n half order, and the `v` value to be either 27 or 28.\n IMPORTANT: `hash` _must_ be the result of a hash operation for the\n verification to be secure: it is possible to craft signatures that\n recover to arbitrary addresses for non-hashed data. A safe way to ensure\n this is by receiving a hash of the original message (which may otherwise\n be too long), and then calling {MessageHashUtils-toEthSignedMessageHash} on

@dev Calculate the modular multiplicative inverse of a number in Z/nZ.\n If n is a prime, then Z/nZ is a field. In that case all elements are inversible, except 0.\n If n is not a prime, then Z/nZ is not a field, and some elements might not be inversible.\n If the input value is not inversible, 0 is returned.\n NOTE: If you know for sure that n is (big) a prime, it may be cheaper to use Fermat's little theorem and get the\n inverse using `Math.modExp(a, n - 2, n)`.
