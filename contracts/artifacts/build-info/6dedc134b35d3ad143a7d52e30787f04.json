Skips emitting an {Approval} event indicating an allowance update. This is not required by the ERC. See {xref-ERC20-_approve-address-address-uint256-bool-}[_approve]. NOTE: Does not update the allowance if the current allowance is the maximum `uint256`. Requirements: - `from` and `to` cannot be the zero address. - `from` must have a balance of at least `value`. - the caller must have allowance for ``from``'s tokens of at least `value`.\"}},\"version\":1},\"userdoc\":{\"kind\":\"user\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1}},\"settings\":{\"compilationTarget\":{\"contracts/src/MockERC20.sol\":\"MockERC20\"},\"evmVersion\":\"paris\",\"libraries\":{},\"metadata\":{\"bytecodeHash\":\"ipfs\"},\"optimizer\":{\"enabled\":true,\"runs\":1000000},\"remappings\":[]},\"sources\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts/interfaces/draft-IERC6093.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x19fdfb0f3b89a230e7dbd1cf416f1a6b531a3ee5db4da483f946320fc74afc0e\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://3490d794728f5bfecb46820431adaff71ba374141545ec20b650bb60353fac23\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmPsfxjVpMcZbpE7BH93DzTpEaktESigEw4SmDzkXuJ4WR\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x86b7b71a6aedefdad89b607378eeab1dcc5389b9ea7d17346d08af01d7190994\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://1dc2db8d94a21eac8efe03adf574c419b08536409b416057a2b5b95cb772c43c\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmZfqJCKVU1ScuX2A7s8WZdQEaikwJbDH5JBrBdKTUT4Gu\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x74ed01eb66b923d0d0cfe3be84604ac04b76482a55f9dd655e1ef4d367f95bc2\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://5282825a626cfe924e504274b864a652b0023591fa66f06a067b25b51ba9b303\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmeCfPykghhMc81VJTrHTC7sF6CRvaA1FXVq2pJhwYp1dV\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/IERC20Metadata.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xd6fa4088198f04eef10c5bce8a2f4d60554b7ec4b987f684393c01bf79b94d9f\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://f95ee0bbd4dd3ac730d066ba3e785ded4565e890dbec2fa7d3b9fe3bad9d0d6e\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmSLr6bHkPFWT7ntj34jmwfyskpwo97T9jZUrk5sz3sdtR\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Context.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x493033a8d1b176a037b2cc6a04dad01a5c157722049bbecf632ca876224dd4b2\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://6a708e8a5bdb1011c2c381c9a5cfd8a9a956d7d0a9dc1bd8bcdaf52f76ef2f12\",\"dweb:/ipfs/Qmax9WHBnVsZP46ZxEMNRQpLQnrdE4dK8LehML1Py8FowF\"]},\"contracts/src/MockERC20.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xef8aee1d0b24b506c97a88757a98ff6abd552ca278c804e428dfd5c9c180f497\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://65c27ae1605e8fcc2867007fbf217e351f278c2add150e05461d1a1ae8ec4899\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmdVfiFjePpgC2aB9XPA1BYh8eFLJpwgZEpkJnKM4hEeTD\"]}},\"version\":1}"}}}}}
